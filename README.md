## Introduction
Composition is the most important principle in programming. It's how
developers build large things from small things without being
overwhelmed by complexity.

ABC is a language that emphasizes composition. A string of ABC denotes
a function, and concatenation of strings corresponds to composition of
functions.

of concatenative programming, and how it relates to the traditional SK
combinators and lambda calculus.
